            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>The Maker Group at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is a forum for all members of the Center to explore constructing 
            low-cost hardware and software engineering tools. The Group focuses on supporting projects that will directly benefit a wide range 
            of research at the Center but also encourages fun home projects. By promoting custom engineering projects at the Center, the Maker 
            Group serves as a significant source of cross discipline training to the postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, technicians and staff. </p>
            <p> The Maker Group was founded in fall 2013 by postdoctoral researchers, Doug Bryant, Noah Fahlgren and Malia Gehan, 
            who saw a need for low-cost plant phenotyping tools and software that would complement the Center's Bellwether Phenotyping Facility. 
            The state-of-the-art, facility is comprised of a custom, controlled environment growth house, fully integrated with 3 imaging platforms. 
            The automated, high-throughput platform allows multi-parametric, non-destructive analysis of up to 1140 small to medium sized plants at 
            multiple time points over a desired growth period.</p>
