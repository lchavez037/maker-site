<b>The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (St. Louis, MO)</b> will host a Raspberry Pi Jam 
at the Center on January 27th, 2018 from 12-4 pm. The Raspberry Pi Jam will bring together 
students, educators, makers, scientists, and the public to foster opportunities for 
collaboration and education.<!--more-->

We hope that this event will inspire current and future scientists to embrace using 
Raspberry Piâ€™s and other open-source hardware to interact and discover the natural world. 
The Jam will feature demonstrations using microcomputers in science, education, robotics, 
and fun.

This event is for both children and adults interested in computers and is free to the public. 
Ample parking is free at the Danforth Plant Science Center. We hope to see you and your family at the Jam!
