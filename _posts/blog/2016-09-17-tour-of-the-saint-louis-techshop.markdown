<b>The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center</b> is a Founding Partner for 
the <a href="http://www.techshop.ws/STL.html" target="_blank">TechShop</a> 
located in the Central West Endâ€™s Cortex technology district. The scientific 
researchers of the Danforth Center were invited recently on a special tour.<!--more-->

The staff of the TechShop welcomed us into the facility and gave some great details on 
the various types of equipment they offer from tools for metal or wood working, 
silkscreen printing, electronics, and even laser cutting. If you have never used a laser 
cutter not to worry! They offer classes to make sure everyone who uses the equipment can 
safely operate and bring their creation to life.

The TechShop is a wonderful addition to the cities growing maker community and expect to 
see some great ideas come out of the TechShop from our Danforth Center Scientist!
