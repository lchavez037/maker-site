<b>Donald Danforth Plant Science Center Maker Shop.</b> With new tools and kits available to members of the Maker Group at the
Donald Danforth Plant Science Center it is now possible to start learning a new skill or starting a project
using the space provided.<!--more-->

Counter top space is available to set up and work on your projects. Multiple outlets along the walls to plug in your Raspberry Pi and test out a program! 
For special project that require specific components or parts a Fortus 250mc 3D Printer is available. A great resource for producing prototypes.

Ready to build something fun with buttons, wires, and LEDs? We have a soldering station with a heat resistant silicone repair mat that also contains 
anti-static tweezers and helping hands with flexible arms. To help you build a prototype board various resisters, LED of various colors, transistors, 
capacitors, and breadboards are available. Start with a breadboard for your idea then use the soldering station to make a final sturdy build using a PCB (Printed Circuit Board).

As a Maker you will need tools to make stuff. A selection of power tools are available from power drills, glue guns, jigsaws, and heat guns 
to help with whatever you are building. In addition to the power tools chisels, tape measures, wire strippers, needle nose pliers, spring clamps, and 
various wrenches are also available.

The goal of the Maker Group at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is to help teach skills that will help benefit a wide range of research at the
Center. With this space to explore and learn we are excited to show case some of the engineered projects researchers will build in the future.
