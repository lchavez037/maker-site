Ben Laws, from the Topp Lab, created a 3D model from excavated maize roots, scanned with an X-Ray CT, 
to create a scaled down 3D model. Ben has presented the 3D models at STEM outreach activities, such 
as the St. Louis Science Center Roots Day at the Grow Exhibit. 

Currently developing troubleshooting document for public use.
