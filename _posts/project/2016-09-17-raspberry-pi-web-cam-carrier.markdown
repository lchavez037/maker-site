A project designed for use in the Bellwether Phenotyping Facility. Raspberry Pi camera is mounted onto a carrier that is normally 
used to grow plants in the growth chamber. A pan and tilt servo is used to control the camera over a WIFI connection either on 
a computer or mobile phone. To power the Raspberry Pi a USB power bank is being used.

This allows us to view within the imaging chambers to troubleshoot problems or monitor bulb outages.
